You have 3 layers.

1. (app layer) server.js
  configure express app to handle expected requests
    * get index page
    * create item
    * get item(s)
    * update items
    * delete item
2. (DB layer) database.js
  respond to app requests
    * create
    * read
    * update
    * delete
3. (presentation layer) public folder with index.html presents the data


0. configure app
1. app server listening for requests
2. client sends valid request ('/')
3. server responds with index.html
4. client sends valid request ('/items')
5. server requests data from database with async function. we don't know how long db will take to respond so run this in the background.
6. 'await' means don't continue main processing until the data comes in. We don't want to return empty handed.
7. once we get the data, return it in json format
